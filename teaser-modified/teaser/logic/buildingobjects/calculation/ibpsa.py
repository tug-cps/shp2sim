    This class holds functions to sort and partly rewrite zone and building

    boundary conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------

    parent: Building()
        The parent class of this object, the Building the attributes are
        calculated for. (default: None)

    Attributes
    ----------

    file_internal_gains : str
        Filename for internal gains file
    version : dict
        Dictionary with supported libraries and their version numbers
    consider_heat_capacity : bool
        decides whether air capacity is considered or not for all thermal
        zones in the building

        This function creates a list with an equidistant profile given the
        duration of the profile in seconds (default one day, 86400 s) and the
        time_step in seconds (default one hour, 3600 s). Needed for boundary
        input of the building for Modelica simulation

        Note
        -----
        As Python starts from counting the range from zero, but Modelica needs
        0 as start value and additional 24 entries. We add one iteration
        step in the profile.

        Parameters
        ----------
        duration_profile : int
            duration of the profile in seconds (default one day, 86400 s)
        time_step : int
            time step used in the profile in seconds (default one hour, 3600 s)

        Returns

        """creates .mat file for internal gains boundary conditions

        This function creates a matfile (-v4) for building internal gains
        boundary conditions. It collects internal gain profiles of a specific
        zones and stores them into one file. It also calculates the internal
        gains from relative presence and values for heat output into W for
        direct usage in Annex models.

        Only person (convective and radiative) and machines (convective) are
        used in the simple Annex 60 examples.

        4 Column : profile_machines, convective

        Note
        ----------
        When time line is created, we need to add a 0 to first element of
        all boundaries. This is due to to expected format in Modelica.

        ----------
        zone : ThermalZone()
            TEASER instance of ThermalZone. As IBPSA computes single models
            for single zones, we need to generate individual files for zones
